 * Channel store — the analytics channel the sequence-analytics surfaces
 * (Dynamics and Patterns) look at.
 *
 *   channel: 'emotion' (the default — pooled emotion windows) | one
 *            signal-event modality ('typing' | 'discourse' | 'interaction'
 *            | 'ai_assist') | 'all' (every modality interleaved).
 *
 * Lifted out of the two screens' local state so a channel picked on Dynamics
 * is still selected on Patterns (and vice versa) — the two tabs are one
 * investigation over one channel, not two independent pickers. Kept separate
 * from filterStore (WHICH sessions/users the dashboards look at): this store
 * describes WHICH signal stream they read, not its scope.
