/*
 * The Settings page is driven by lib/settingsNav.ts: that module declares the
 * sections, their order and their grouping, and routes/settings.tsx supplies
 * each section's body keyed by the same id.
 *
 * That split is only safe if the two key sets stay identical. They are plain
 * string keys, so TypeScript is happy either way — a section present in the
 * nav but missing a body renders nothing (an empty group heading), and a body
 * whose id is not in the nav is never rendered at all. Both are silent. This
 * test is the thing that makes them loud.
 *
 * The same defect species has bitten this repo before: AU keys vs
 * ACTION_UNIT_MAP, snapshotSettings vs DEFAULT_SETTINGS, the barrel vs the
 * module list. Hand-maintained mirrors need an assertion, not discipline.
